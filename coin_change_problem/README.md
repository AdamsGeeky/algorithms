## Coin Change Problem  
In this repository, I have compiled a few different ways to tackle the coin change problem.  
  
For now, the coin change problem is for a given sum to return the minimum number of coins to give the exact change.  
This is a work in progress. The algorithms I have for now are:  
- greedy approach using recursion  
- recursive approach  
- recursive approach with memoization  
- dynamic approach with a table  
- dynamic approach with an array  
Next work would include timing the different codes, varying the list of coins...
